	  Creating Medical Pedigree with PSTricks and LaTeX
		  Boris Veytsman & Leila Akhmadeeva
		       Version 0.2a, April 2006
	
This package is a set of macros based on PSTricks to draw medical
pedigrees according to the recommendations for standardized human
pedigree nomenclature.  The drawing commands place the symbols on a
pspicture canvas.  An interface for making trees is also provided.
The package can be used both with LaTeX and PlainTeX.  A separate
Perl program for generating TeX files from spreadsheets is
provided elsewhere on CTAN.

To extract the files, run pst-pdgr.ins through latex.  Then move the
files pst-pdgr.sty & pst-pdgr.cfg to the place where LaTeX files are
kept in your system, e. g. /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/pst-pdgr/, and
the file pst-pdgr.tex to the place where generic TeX files are kept in
your system, e.g.  /usr/share/texmf/tex/generic/pstricks/pst-pdgr/.

The documentation is in the file pst-pdgr.pdf. You may use the
provided Makefile to re-typeset it.
