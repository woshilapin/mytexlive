%% Package `pst-light3d.tex'
%%
This version of pst-light3d needs the xkeyval package. Get it
from CTAN if it is not part of your local TeX installation.

Save the files

pst-light3d.sty   TEXMF/tex/latex/pstricks/
pst-light3d.tex   TEXMF/tex/generic/pstricks/
pst-light3d.pro   TEXMF/dvips/pstricks/

in any place, where latex or any other TeX program will find it.
If you like to get the documentation file in another format run 

latex pst-light3d-doc
latex pst-light3d-doc
dvips pst-light3d-doc

to get a PostScript file. But pay attention, that the pst-light3d
files are saved in the above mentioned way, before you run
latex on the documentation file.

The intermediate DVI file works only with viewers which can 
interprete the embedded PostScript code.

For another PDF output read the introduction from
the documentation.
